# NutriTrack

NutriTrack is a comprehensive health and nutrition platform designed to help individuals track their dietary intake, stay aware of vitamin deficiencies, and connect with nutritionists. Built using React.js, NutriTrack offers a user-friendly interface for managing your health and nutrition goals. NutriTrack addresses key aspects of health by helping users monitor and manage their nutritional intake. For example, the platform educates users on vitamin deficiencies and provides food recommendations based on their specific needs, age, and daily intake requirements. It offers a BMI calculator for personalized food suggestions and tracks daily water intake, tailored to individual age groups. Additionally, users can quickly look up the nutritional values of foods and track their daily calorie intake by adding food items to a food cart, with categories including fruits, vegetables, junk foods, desserts, breakfast items, and beverages. The platform also makes it easy to find and connect with nutritionists for personalized advice.
